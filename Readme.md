# Purpose
The purpose of this script is to run some very basic finite-difference time-domain methods to solve very basic EM problems. The problems are described in the files "HW 1.pdf" and "HW 2.pdf".

# Dependencies
To successfully run the following dependencies must be installed. I used homebrew to install since I am using a macbook.
- boost
- gnuplot

Note that gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, and VMS (i.e it is not a c++ library). In order to faciliate the connection between c++ and gnuplot. This is done using gnuplot-iostream.h. This file can easily be found on github in the gnuplot-iostream library. For simplicity the file is included in this repository and no action is needed for it to work (at least on Macbook and Linux)
